# 5. IoT & Smart City Technology:
Smart cities use Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as connected sensors, lights, and meters to collect and analyze data. The cities then use this data to improve infrastructure, public utilities and services, and more.

# 6.     AI & ML in Smart Urban Areas:
Machine learning generally takes the data generated by several apps such as Health MD applications, internet-enabled cars, etc. and leverages it to identify patterns and learn how to optimize the given set of services. Its tools are able to personalize the smart city experience by aggregating information about the most used roads in a city and then apply it to a transportation system.

On the other hand, machine learning and AI can be helpful in waste collection and its proper management and disposal which is a vital municipal activity in a city. Thus, the technology for smart recycling and waste management provides a sustainable waste management system. AI has the ability to understand how cities are being used and how they are functioning. It assists city planners in comprehending how the city is responding to various changes and initiatives.

# 13.  Visual Question Answering using Deep Learning:
Visual Question Answering is a research area about building an AI system to answer questions presented in a natural language about an image.

A system that solves this task demonstrates a more general understanding of images: it must be able to answer completely different questions about an image, oftentimes even addressing different sections of the image.

# 14.  Social Media Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Dataset:
Twitter boasts 330 million monthly active users, which allows businesses to reach a broad audience and connect with customers without intermediaries. On the downside, there is so much information that it’s hard for brands to quickly detect negative social mentions that could harm their business.

That’s why sentiment analysis, which involves monitoring emotions in conversations on social media platforms, has become a key strategy in social media marketing.

Listening to how customers feel on Twitter allows companies to understand their audience, keep on top of what’s being said about their brand, and their competitors, and discover new trends in the industry.

# 15.  Multimodality medical image fusion:
Tools: MATLAB/Python, Description: An image fusion based on multimodal medical images renders a considerable enhancement in the quality of fused images. An effective image fusion technique produces output images by preserving all the viable and prominent information gathered from the source images without any introduction of flaws or unnecessary distortions.

# 16.  Medical Image denoising:
Tool: MATLAB/Python, Description: medical imaging is frequently justified in the follow up of a disease which is already diagnosed and treated. Medical images like any other form of imaging techniques are susceptible to noise and artifacts. Noise can be random or white noise with an even frequency distribution or frequency dependent noise introduced by a device’s mechanism or signal processing algorithms. The presence of noise makes the images unclear and may perplex the identification and analysis of diseases which may result heavy losses including deaths. Hence, denoising of medical images is a mandatory and essential pre-processing technique for further medical image processing stages.

# 18.  Cloud based Android Malware Feature Extraction:
Write a script that performs the following function s(features extracted by static analysis)

a. For the apks present in dataset, diassemble the apk

b. Extract the permission features from the manifest files.

c. The features extracted should be converted into a csv file. Thus for each apk there should be a row in the csv. The columns of the csv will be the different permission. The value for each apk will be 0 or 1 based on permission present or absent.

* Use a cloud platform for performing project. Dataset- Use any dataset available at this [link](https://github.com/traceflight/Android-Malware-Datasets)

#19.  Android Dynamic Feature Extraction (API extraction):#
Write a script that performs the following functions (features extracted by dynamic analysis)

a. For the apks present in dataset, Runs the apk in a secure environment (in a VM)

b. Using the tools extract the API calls (AndroidTamer->MobSF can be used here) that the apk makes during its execution.

c. Converts the obtained API calls details into a csv file. Thus for each apk there should be a row in the csv. The columns of the csv will be the different API calls. The value for each apk will be 0 or 1 based on API call present or absent

Android Tamer is a VM consisting of several Android analysis tools ranging from analysis to pentesting. 8GB RAM is must otherwise the speed of the application slows down w.r.t. responsiveness.

# 20.  Android APP penetration testing:
Perform penetration testing of the web based mobile apps (use the BurpSuite for this). Exploit the XSS vulnerability by using browser on the emulator. You will need to set up proxy setting on the emulator. Setting will also be made in the Burpsuite to intercept the requests from app and then these requests can be tampered. Create a demo app(web based) and include a search text box in this. When you query using this search box, you can intercept this search string using Burp and then also tamper it.

# 21.  Andoid APP penetration testing and security breach:
Try to exploit the vulnerable components of an app (benign app) from another app (malicious app). Do the following

a. Create a demo app with a login screen

b. Once valid credentials are provided it should take you to the next screen/page.

c. Try to open the second screen/page directly from the malicious app.

d. Then also provide a fix for this vulnerability.

e. Once done, now again try to access the second screen/page from the malicious app by encoding permissions in the malicious app.

This scenario demonstrates how a malicious app tries to access secure area of a genuine app with code vulnerabilities.
